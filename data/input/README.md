The master table is saved as part of this repo.
The many tables to be unified are not --
that would be too much data for GitHub to handle happily.
Those other tables can be found at
`https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JlcRgcPDsjhJx7oP5g_A64wZkKYwH2rp?usp=sharing`.
They will be stored next to this `README.md` file, at
`data/input/others/`,
which path is in the `.gitignore` file at the top of the project.
