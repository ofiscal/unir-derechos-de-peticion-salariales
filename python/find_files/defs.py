WHAT A `Genealogy` IS:
This describes the filesystem hierarchy.
In each `Genealogy`, the `descendent` will descend from the `agency`.
The `agency` field in every `Genealogy`
will be a child of `agency_response_folder`.

WHY I NEED TO USE `Genealogy`:
Not every `planta` file is a child (immediate descendent)
of the agency folder it belongs to --some are buried deep.

Pairs would work too, allowing me to avoid defining a class,
but this type is easier for a reader to reason about,
because they can ignore the order of the fields. """
