   Hopefully they always start with "EMPLEADOS PÚBLICOS",
   have a few "NIVEL *" values after that,
   then "TRABAJADORES OFICIALES"
   and maybe (so far I haven't seen any) a set of values after that,
   and then the totals.
* select files
** Start with all files F such that
*** the "agency ancestor" of F is A
    where agency ancestor = nearest ancestor folder at the level of agency
*** F is the only descendent of A matching regex "planta|cargo"
    using case-insensitive matching
* transformation strategy
  serial
** select rectangle
   serial
*** Delete all but first sheet.
*** Delete all rows until the first that matches DENOMINACIÓN DE CARGOS
    maybe with a regex to finesse the tilde
*** Find where the first column becomes "endish"
    where "endish" = permanently empty (from there on),
    *or* contains an expression like "RESUMEN - ANTEPROYECTO PLANTA DE PERSONAL"
*** delete that row and all subsequent rows
** delete empty rows in rectangle
** create a boolean "should-be-column" colun

*** how to define it
    True for each row in which "grado" is missing.
*** why
    It seems to be missing at every category,
    and at none of the empleados.
*** PITFALL: sometimes there are two "grado" columns
** BLOCKED (needs [[id:c806aaf5-8748-450f-96ee-14516157acba][investigation]]) : make "should-be-column" rows a column
