   Hopefully they always start with "EMPLEADOS PÚBLICOS",
   have a few "NIVEL *" values after that,
   then "TRABAJADORES OFICIALES"
   and maybe (so far I haven't seen any) a set of values after that,
   and then the totals.
* DONE find all files F such that
** F matches regex "planta|cargo.*\.xls."
** the "agency ancestor" of F is A
   where agency ancestor = nearest ancestor folder at the level of agency
** F is the only descendent of A matching regex "planta|cargo"
   using case-insensitive matching
* transformation strategy
  serial
** DONE select rectangle
   serial
*** Delete all but first sheet.
*** Delete all rows until the first that matches DENOMINACIÓN DE CARGOS
    maybe with a regex to finesse the tilde
*** Find where the first column becomes "endish"
    where "endish" = permanently empty (from there on),
    *or* contains an expression like "RESUMEN - ANTEPROYECTO PLANTA DE PERSONAL"
*** delete that row and all subsequent rows
** DONE delete empty rows in rectangle
** DONE interpret header
*** in the first three rows, fill each missing with the previous
    use ffillna() with method 'ffill' (forward fill)
*** replace missing values in the fourth row with ""
*** set header to the concatenation of first four rows
*** drop first four rows
** lowercase column names
** UNNEEDED: drop, or worry at all about, total columns
*** what that would be
    drop all columns matching "total" in the name,
    for which "grado" missing
*** why it isn't needed
    I'll drop those with the other rows that aren't real rows,
    and since the totals are last they won't interfere
    with the new "was rows" column either.
** create a boolean "should-be-column" column

   :END:
*** how to define it
    True for each row in which "grado" is missing.
*** why
    It seems to be missing at every category,
    and at none of the empleados.
*** PITFALL: sometimes there are two "grado" columns
** lowercase the "cargo name" for all rows that should be columns
** drop all rows that have now been transcribed as columns
** BLOCKED (needs [[id:c806aaf5-8748-450f-96ee-14516157acba][investigation]]) : make "should-be-column" rows a column
* use exceptions
** try to think of all possible errors
*** regexes don't match
*** header doesn't make sense
** structure
*** keep two dictionaries: failures and successes
*** the keys of both dictionaries are paths to tables
*** the error is an enum type indicating what failed
